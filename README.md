A Survival Horror game developed using the Godot Engine 3.2.1 and C#. You must solve puzzles while avoiding being caught by a weird creature.<br/>

Obs:<br/>
There are binaries available for [Linux x64](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZpmM6kZ2GhdW3Xchhu1pvyaF4vAKHlWK1yy). and [Windows x64](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZzmM6kZn1dtT4cC6FQ3sPpBh9lRKhiuxbty).<br/><br/>
If you want to build the project, remember to bake the GI Probes inside "experiment_facility.tscn" and "experiment_facility_debug.tscn", they were commited without their baked data to ensure the scenes would weigh less than 50 megabytes.<br/><br/>
A trailer video will be added soon.
