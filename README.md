Humans: Milestone is a Survival Horror open source game developed using the Godot Engine 3.2.1. The game is about humans being used as samples in an experiment made by a more advanced and unknown civilization. They want to find out how intelligent humans are, exposing humans to a very stressful experiment where the sample must solve puzzles while avoiding getting caught by a weird creature. Some data is collected and analyzed by this unknown civilization to come to a conclusion about how intelligent that sample is.

Obs:<br/>
There are binaries available for Linux x64 and Windows x64 [here](https://biorobot.itch.io/humans-milestone#download).

If you want to build the project, remember to bake the GI Probes inside "experiment_facility.tscn" and "experiment_facility_debug.tscn", they were commited without their baked data to ensure the scenes would weigh less than 50 megabytes.<br/><br/>
You can watch a video of the game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BL7vPedSl0)
